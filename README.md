## linear regression problem
'addi_lower1.jpg' and 'addi_upper1.jpg' are the lower and upper gaps of linear regression problem, respectively.

'addi_testerror1.jpg' and 'addi_testerrortable1.jpg' are the figure and reltative table of the test error and the experimental results, respectively.

## fair classification problem
'addi_lower2.jpg' and 'addi_upper2.jpg' are the lower and upper gaps of additional experiment, respectively.

'addi_accuracy2.jpg' and 'addi_accuracytable2.jpg' are the figure and reltative table of the accuracy and the experimental results, respectively.

## Explanation for Pictures of Comparing additional method
'compare_lower1.jpg' and 'compare_upper1.jpg' are the lower gap and upper value when the maximum iterations of "R-APM" is equals to our penalty parameter, respectively, i.e., $K = 1/\eta = \gamma$.

'compare_lower1.jpg' and 'compare_upper1.jpg' are the lower gap and upper value when the maximum iterations of "R-APM" is less than our penalty parameter, respectively, i.e., $K = 1/\eta \leq \gamma$.
